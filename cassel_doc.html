<h3>Cassel Class documentation</h3>
<div class="shead">What is this?</div>
<!--  <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
This is a simple (yes, quite simple) PHP class to create N-Tier cascading
select inputs which act on the client side. 
Basically, you can have as many selects as you like, with as 
many dependancies between them as you like -- the onus is on you, of course,
to prevent cyclic action between selects that are set as parents of each other
in your code. But apart from being careful there, you really just have to 
create the selects that you want, with the control structure that you want.
And you only have to use the class for parent (driving) selects: child (driven)
selects can be created in the normal way, in html.
</div>

<div class="shead">but why?</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
I wanted to be able to create N-tier cascading selects (basically, I didn't
want a restriction on how many tiers in the cascading process could be
required), and I wanted to allow for a select to drive more than one child
select. Also, I wanted the interface to be relatively simple. I think I've 
acheived these aims, with the proviso that, whilst the interface is quite
simple and intuitive, you do need to keep track of your code, as there are
a few levels of nesting within arrays. You have been warned.

<div class="shead">About style and other such things</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section"><p>
	I tend to do just about all of my coding in VIM. Actually, I stick to using
	the graphical version (GVIM), but sometimes make short trips to the land
	of the console. My reasons are simple: I need a uniform development 
	environment on win32 and linux (because I'm forced to use the first, and
	I love to use the second), and I needed something powerful, yet simple
	and, quite importantly, free. Not just free as in beer -- free as in
	licensing. I believe that the days of closed-source applications are
	over. Commercial apps can still be written: a coder has to eat and feed
	his wife and all that. But your clients deserve disclosure on the source, 
	should you be abducted by aliens or something similar. Or even just so they
	can also hire a hacker to implement features you didn't think of. But
	enough of that.</p>
	<p>Also, whilst VIM may give an initially steep learning curve, and
	seem to contain unnecessary keyboard work, you will find that other
	editors become annoying after you find the true power in vim. Also, very
	few other editors are as ready to adapt to the coder's wishes.</p>
	<p>The point is that you might notice a few commented out &lt;&lt;&lt;'s
	and corresponding &gt;&gt;&gt;'s. This is not an angle-bracket fetish: it's
	my choice for fold markers in vim (thanks to a friend) because curly braces
	cause problems in Tcl (even when commented), and tend to mess up the
	brace-matching for languages that use braces for code blocks, since
	vim cannot always tell what is a code brace, and what is a fold brace.
	You also might notice that I tend to stick to an 80 column line. This can
	make some sections of deep code a little short on space, but it's something
	I do as a matter of style (thanks to the same friend). It makes for
	easier reading on a terminal, and means that the code is more easily
	available to anyone who has time to waste on it.</p>

<div class="shead">Usage</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
Usage is quite simple. You can instantiate the class with an array of
elements that will be assigned to member elements of the class at the time
of construction, or you can do it all step-by-step, assigning member
variables as you see fit. When you have the select set up to your requirements,
you just have to call on the render() member function to create an output.
</p>
<p>
The select object has the following settable member values:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Default</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>id</td>
	<td>id of the element created in html. Must be unique if you want to 
		avoid oddities</td>
	<td>left as a blank string -- you must set this, otherwise cascading
		will not work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>name</td>
	<td>name of the element created in html, and, of course, name of the
		resultant value in the page receiving this form's information.</td>
	<td>set to the id of the select</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>style</td>
	<td>Valid CSS style string -- if there is no colon (:) in the string, it
		is assumed to be a CSS class name, if non-blank</td>
	<td>left blank -- default page style rules</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>sel_idx</td>
	<td>Index of initial selection. The index is taken as the value you set
		for an option</td>
	<td>left blank</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>sel_val</td>
	<td>Value of initial selection. Actually, this is the textural
		representation of the option item you want selected; ie the value
		that the user sees</td>
	<td>left blank</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>set_on_start</td>
	<td>boolean value which determines whether or not the javascript cascade
		functions for Cassel items are run when the page is loaded, to make
		sure that child items are properly populated.</td>
	<td>True (ie the functions are run)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>cascades</td>
	<td>Cascade definitions. These are explained below</td>
	<td>left blank</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>defaults</td>
	<td>Default values for child selects. This is a nested array</td>
	<td>left blank</td>
</tr>
</table>
Note that all of these items can be set in an array (using the same name as the
member function) passed to the constructor; eg:
<div class="codeblock">
$foo = new Cassel(array(<br>
"id" => "myid",<br>
...
));
</div>
</p>
<p>
Cascade definitions decide not only what the cascading rules are, but also the
contents of this Cassel object's output select item. The format is, quite
simply:
<div class="codeblock">
[01]&nbsp;$cascades = array(<br>
[02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;option_value0&quot; => array(<br>
[03]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;option_text0&quot; => array(<br>
[04]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;childid0&quot;=> array(<br>
[05]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;child_option_value0&quot; => &quot;child_option_text0&quot;<br>
[06]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
[07]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
[08]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
[09]&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
[10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;option_value1&quot; => &quot;option_text2&quot;,<br>
[11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;__default__&quot; => array(<br>
[12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;childid1&quot; => array(<br>
[13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;child_option_value1&quot; => &quot;child_option_text1&quot;,<br>
[14]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
[15]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
[16]&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
[17]&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;
...<br>
);<br>
</div>
Although, that might not look so simple! But it really is quite logical. Let's
examine what we have there...
<p>Lines 01 to 09 define a standard sort of cascade. The Cassel object gets
an option with the value &quot;option_value0&quot; and the text 
&quot;option_text0&quot;, and all children listed with child ids as sub-arrays
of that text get the option lists defined in them when &quot;option_value0&quot;
is selected by the user. In this case, the select with the id child0 will
have the array defined in lines 04 to 06 as the option list when the user 
selects &quot;option_text0&quot; from the list.
</p>
<p>Line 10 describes a standard entry for the Cassel select object. This entry
just creates the option in the select, and doesn't have any implicit cascading
actions. But hang on, what's next?</p?
<p>Lines 11 to 17 define what is to be done for items in the Cassel options
array that do not have implicit cascading functionality set. The name
&quot;__default__&quot; is not hard-coded: you can change it with the 
member property default_name -- this is just the default value of the
default name (if you get what I mean) so, unless you have some reson to use
&quot;__default__&quot; in your option lists' values, you can just stick
to how I use the default name. Anyway, you can see that the arrangement of
the __default__ option is a little different from the regular cascade, simply
because it doesn't have to monitor a specific value in the parent select.
Also note that the __default__ settings do not affect the option list that 
the Cassel object produces -- this index in the array is ignored on render.</p>
<p>So, we see that we have a lot of flexibility at the expense of a little
complexity in definition. But you can have a look at the test_cassel.php
page to see the cassel object in action -- I think that a demonstration
makes things a little clearer.</p>
<p>I'm sure that it also becomes apparent that you can have as many levels of
cascade as you want -- just make Cassel objects children of other Cassel 
objects, as we see in the test page. Also, the architecture allows branching
whereby we can have one select driving another <i>N</i> selects, which each 
drive another <i>N</i> selects, and so on, and so on (where <i>N</i> is any
positive integer). You can have children that drive no others (look at column
2, the upper select, in the test page), or children that are parents to
others (look at the lower select in column 2 on the test page). You are
really only limited by the application you want to write  (: .
</p>
<p>The defaults directive in the definition you pass to the cassel object defines
a set of default values for child select objects, and it's both quite simple and 
optional. Basically, we have an array where the indeces are the values that we
added into our cassel object, and each element is a description of the default
values to apply to children when that value is selected. Note that the 
&qout;value&quot; I'm talking about here is <b>not</b> the text of the selected
item -- it is the actual value, which would be passed through on a form.</p>
<p>Perhaps an example will clear things up a little. Taken from the 
test_cassel.php page, if I wanted the cassel object with the id &quot;parent&quot;
(which is the one on the extreme left) to ensure that the object with id
&quot;child0&quot; (the select in the second column, at the top) to have a
value of 103 (which is the <b>value</b> of the item in the list), I could
set the &quot;defaults&quot; element of the definition like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&quot;defaults&quot; =&gt; array(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;1 =&gt; array(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;child0&quot; =&gt; &quot;103&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
&nbsp;...<br>
</div>
<p>(In fact, that's exactly what i did do  (: ). This follows the concept:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&quot;defaults&quot; =&gt; array(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[parent value] =&gt; array(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[child id]&quot; =&gt; &quot;[child value or text]&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br>
&nbsp;...<br>
</div>
<p>Whilst this may seem a little more complex than you might expect, we can see
from the definition that we could specify default values for any number of child
selects (by adding the the child id's into the arrays for each value in the
parent where a default selection is required on said child), and for any of the
parent values in the cassel object (by simply adding the values as indeces of 
child reference arrays)<p>
<p>A side note: you may use child text-values for the matches in the child 
definitions -- as hinted at by the [child value or text] in the generic concept<p>
<p>Sorry if the documentation here is a little confusing or vague -- please
check out the test_cassel.php script to see this all in action.</p>
